## 1. About Us Page

```html
<div class="about-us-container">
    <h2>Reliving the Golden Era of Gaming</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>RetroConsoleHub</strong>, a digital sanctuary for those who believe that 8-bit and 16-bit graphics hold a charm that 4K simply cannot replace.</p>
    
    <p>We are a passionate group of retro gaming enthusiasts who grew up blowing into cartridges, memorizing cheat codes, and spending weekends conquering pixelated worlds. For us, gaming isn't just a hobby; it's a time machine that takes us back to our fondest memories.</p>

    <h3>Why We Started</h3>
    <p>The retro gaming market is flooded with clones, emulators, and nostalgic promises. Unfortunately, not all of them deliver the experience we remember. We've seen too many gamers waste money on cheap knock-offs that lag, crash, or feel "off."</p>

    <p><strong>We built RetroConsoleHub to change that.</strong></p>

    <p>Our mission is simple: to filter through the noise and highlight only the <strong>reliable, high-quality retro consoles</strong> that truly honor the classics. Whether you are looking to replay <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> on a modern TV or introduce your kids to the magic of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>, we are here to guide you to the right hardware.</p>

    <p>Game on,<br>
    <strong>The RetroConsoleHub Team</strong></p>

    <h2>Transparency & Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
    <p>At <strong>RetroConsoleHub</strong>, we believe in being 100% transparent with our audience. Our goal is to provide you with the best recommendations for retro gaming gear, and to do that, we sometimes use affiliate links.</p>

## 3. Editorial Policy Page

```html
<div class="editorial-policy">
    <h2>Our Editorial Standards</h2>
    <p>Integrity is the core of <strong>RetroConsoleHub</strong>. We understand that you rely on our advice to make purchasing decisions, and we take that responsibility seriously.</p>

    <h3>Data-Driven Reviews</h3>
    <p>Unlike many review sites that rely solely on subjective opinion, our reviews are <strong>data-driven</strong>. We utilize advanced automated tools to analyze thousands of real user reviews, ratings, and feedback from across the web. This allows us to identify patterns—both good and bad—that a single reviewer might miss.</p>

    <h3>Unbiased & Independent</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Paid Placements:</strong> We do not accept money from manufacturers to write positive reviews or to rank their products higher.</li>
        <li><strong>Real User Sentiments:</strong> Our recommendations are based on what actual gamers are saying. If a console has input lag or poor build quality, our data analysis catches it, and we tell you.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our loyalty is to you, the gamer, not to any brand or company.</p>
